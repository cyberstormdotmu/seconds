<ol start="3">
	<li><span ><strong >THE SILVERWING SERVICE</strong></span>

		<ol>
			<li><span >The Silverwing Service allows Silverwing Account Holders to purchase products from Suppliers and the opportunity to qualify for rewards in the form of &lsquo;Silverwing Credits&rsquo;, for the purchases they make. &nbsp;All contracts for the sale of such products from Suppliers are made between you and that Supplier and on the terms of sale of that Supplier. &nbsp;Silverwing only provides the services as outlined in this section 3.&nbsp;</span></li>
			<li><span >Orders are placed by Account Holders via the Silverwing Platform. Silverwing will notify the associated supplier of any orders and the supplier is responsible for notifying Silverwing that they accept the order under their terms of service. Once Silverwing receives this notification, the order will be considered &lsquo;Accepted&rsquo; and will constitute a &lsquo;Qualifying Purchase&rsquo; - please see 3.2.5 in relation to Qualifying Purchases.&nbsp;</span></li>
			<li><span ><strong><span>THE SILVERWING PRICE CURVE</span></strong>&nbsp;</span>

				<ol>
					<li><span >The pricing structure for each product sold by Suppliers via the Silverwing Service is visible to Silverwing Account Holders as a graph showing price in pounds against the quantity of units sold. This graph is known as the &lsquo;Silverwing Price Curve&rsquo; and is distinct for each product available for purchase as per the example shown below:<br/><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); float: none; display: inline !important;"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span class="fr-img-wrap" style="width: 602px;"><img src="images/SilverwingPriceCurveExample.jpg" name="Picture 36" align="bottom" width="602" height="312" border="0" class="fr-fil fr-dib"><span class="fr-inner" contenteditable="true"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); float: none; display: inline !important;">Example Silverwing Price Curve</span></p></span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li><span >Through the Silverwing Service a Silverwing Account Holder is able to purchase products in accordance with its distinct Silverwing Price Curve (or &lsquo;Relevant Silverwing Price Curve&rsquo;).</span></span>
					</li>
					<li><span >Each Silverwing Price Curve is only available for a set period of time (the &lsquo;Offer Period&rsquo;). &nbsp;The Offer Period of a product is visible to the Silverwing Account Holder on the Silverwing Platform. &nbsp;Once the Offer Period has ended, the product will no longer be available for purchase under that specific Price Curve.</span></li>
					<li><span >The price of each product at any given time within the Offer Period is dependent on the volume of units already sold for that product, in accordance with the Relevant Silverwing Price Curve. &nbsp;The price payable for a product at any given time within the Offer Period is known as the &lsquo;Current Price&rsquo;.</span></li>
					<li><span >The impact of &lsquo;Qualifying Purchases&rsquo; on the Current Price of the product for sale is updated in real-time. &nbsp;Qualifying Purchases are those purchases made by Silverwing Account Holders which have been confirmed by the Supplier and/or have not for any reason subsequently been cancelled or withdrawn by Silverwing or the Supplier, or returned by you (see section 3.8 Returns).</span></li>
					<li><span >Should a Silverwing Account Holder make a Qualifying Purchase at the Current Price, from that point onwards the Current Price shall be known as the &lsquo;Price Paid&rsquo; by that Silverwing Account Holder.</span></li>
					<li><span >The &lsquo;Final Price&rsquo; is equal to the Current Price at the exact time the Offer Period ends.</span></li>
					<li><span >The &lsquo;Target Price&rsquo; is the minimum price achievable for a product within any Relevant Silverwing Price Curve.</span></li>
					<li><span >All prices are shown on the Relevant Silverwing Price Curve excluding VAT.&nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span >In accordance with the Current Price and the pricing structure set out within the Silverwing Price Curve under which a Qualifying Purchase was made, &lsquo;Silverwing Credits&rsquo; (see Section 3.4) will be displayed as a positive account balance on the Account. &nbsp;</span></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span ><strong>PAYMENT METHODS&nbsp;</strong>All new Silverwing Account Holders are required to complete a Supplier Credit Facility application before an order can be placed using the Silverwing Service.&nbsp;</span>

				<ol>
					<li><span ><strong>PAYMENT VIA CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD</strong></span>

						<ol>
							<li><span >Silverwing facilitates your payment for products ordered from Suppliers by accepting card payments through the Silverwing Platform. &nbsp;Silverwing is not an agent of the Supplier and does not act on behalf of the Supplier in relation to any payments made through the Silverwing Platform.</span></li>
							<li><span >Silverwing Account Holders may use the Silverwing Service to make purchases and pay via debit or credit card at the point of sale.</span></li>
							<li><span >Credit or debit card transactions may be subject to a card processing fee which is payable by you and is non-refundable.&nbsp;</span></li>
							<li><span >In accordance with the Silverwing Price Curve under which a Qualifying Purchase is made, any applicable Silverwing Credits will be displayed as a positive account balance on the Account and as &lsquo;Available&rsquo; once the full payment of the Price Paid has been received. &nbsp;Payment via a card transaction can take up to four days to be received &ndash; please see sections 3.5 and 3.6 in relation to Silverwing Credits.</span></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><span ><strong>PAYMENT VIA SILVERWING CREDITS</strong></span>

						<ol>
							<li><span >Silverwing Account Holders are able to use their Available Silverwing Credits to make purchases with Suppliers. &nbsp;This is known as &lsquo;Offsetting&rsquo; please see section 3.6 Redeeming Silverwing Credits.</span></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><span ><strong>PAYMENT VIA SUPPLIER CREDIT FACILITY</strong></span>

						<ol>
							<li><span >Silverwing Account Holders may use the Silverwing Service to make purchases using their Supplier Credit Facility. (Please see section 3.8 for Supplier Credit Facility Application).</span></li>
							<li><span >If you have purchased products using credit granted under a Supplier Credit Facility, it is the Supplier and not Silverwing that will pursue payment from you.</span></li>
							<li><span >If you have purchased products using credit granted under a Supplier Credit Facility, it is your responsibility to honour the terms of that agreement. Suppliers are responsible for keeping Silverwing duly notified as to an Account Holder&rsquo;s repayment performance against their Supplier Credit Facility.</span></li>
							<li><span >In accordance with the Silverwing Price Curve under which a Qualifying Purchase is made, Silverwing Credits will be displayed as a positive account balance on the Account.</span></li>
							<li><span >The Supplier will notify Silverwing once they have received payment in full for the product in question. &nbsp;Once we receive confirmation from the Supplier of a payment in full in relation to the Qualifying Purchase, we will change the status of the Silverwing Account Holder&rsquo;s Silverwing Credits from Pending to Available. &nbsp;Available Silverwing Credits may then be used in accordance with section 3.5 Silverwing Credits.</span></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span ><strong>SILVERWING CREDITS</strong>&nbsp;</span>

				<ol>
					<li><span >As a Silverwing Account Holder, should you make a Qualifying Purchase you will benefit from the collective of Qualifying Purchases made by all other Silverwing Account Holders under the same Silverwing Price Curve.</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing Account Holders will be able to see a positive balance on their Silverwing Account (&lsquo;Silverwing Credits&rsquo;) where, in accordance with the Relevant Silverwing Price Curve, the Current Price of the offer is less than the Price Paid. &nbsp;The Silverwing Credits appearing on an Account will be equal to the difference between the Price Paid less the Current Price. &nbsp;Silverwing Credits will continue to be added on the Account until the Offer Period ends, at which point no further Silverwing Credits will be added in relation to that Relevant Silverwing Price Curve. &nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing Credits and your associated Silverwing Credit Balance represents the total of Supplier Credits that you have received in relation to your Qualifying Orders. &nbsp;Your Silverwing Credit Balance may therefore be comprised of Credits from one, or more than one, Supplier(s). &nbsp;You will receive a credit note from the Supplier who fulfilled your Qualifying Purchase, where you have paid in full for the purchase in question, and in whichever of the following circumstances occurs first:&nbsp;</span>

						<ol>
							<li><span >If you fully or partially Offset or Withdraw Available Silverwing Credits which originated from an Offer that is not yet closed (i.e. the Offer Period has not ended). &nbsp;The credit note will reflect the amount of Available credits which you have chosen to Offset or Withdraw;</span></li>
							<li><span >If the Target Price of an Offer is reached. &nbsp;The Target Price is the lowest price payable for the goods, in accordance with the Silverwing Price Curve, and therefore you will not receive any further Silverwing Credits in relation to that Offer; or</span></li>
							<li><span >When an Offer Period ends, and you have not already received a credit note which has detailed the total and final amount of Silverwing Credits you have received in relation to that Offer.</span></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><span >Silverwing Credits do not themselves represent a sum of money held by Silverwing on behalf of the Silverwing Account Holder. &nbsp;Silverwing Credits represent the savings on the Price Paid that the Supplier has been able to pass onto Silverwing Account Holders, due to the collective impact of all Silverwing Account Holder purchases made against the Silverwing Price Curve.</span></li>
					<li><span >We reserve the right to withdraw availability of Silverwing Credits on your Account in the event that your Operating Company suspends, or threatens to suspend, payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or admits inability to pay its debts or is deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986.</span></li>
					<li><span >A reduction in the Current Price will instantly result in applicable Silverwing Credits showing on the Accounts of all Silverwing Account Holders who made Qualifying Purchases under the Relevant Silverwing Price Curve. &nbsp;Silverwing Account Holders are able to view their Silverwing Credits on the Silverwing Platform.&nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing Credits will show as Pending and will not be Available for use by the Silverwing Account Holder until Silverwing has either received notification of payment from the Supplier for the full amount of the Price Paid or you paid for the full amount of the Price Paid for your Qualifying Purchase via debit card or credit card and the relevant funds have been received, which can take up to four days in practice.&nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span >It is the responsibility of you and your Operating Company to ensure that you appropriately account for VAT on any purchases you make on the Platform and any Silverwing Credits you receive, in accordance with applicable laws, legislation and accounting standards.&nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span >From time to time, Silverwing may offer Silverwing Account Holders the opportunity to earn additional Silverwing Credits outside the normal Silverwing Price Curve process, such as within a referral scheme (&lsquo;Bonus Silverwing Credits&rsquo;). &nbsp;Bonus Silverwing Credits cannot be Withdrawn (defined below) and are only Available to spend on Silverwing Services. &nbsp;There will be distinct terms and conditions which will be applicable for any Silverwing Account Holders who choose to partake in any Bonus Silverwing Credits.&nbsp;</span></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span ><strong>REDEEMING SILVERWING CREDITS</strong></span>

				<ol>
					<li><span >As a Silverwing Account Holder, you are entitled to have your Available Silverwing Credits converted into a cash payment which is made to the bank details registered with us (&lsquo;Withdraw&rsquo;/&lsquo;Withdrawal&rsquo;), or you are entitled to offset your Silverwing Credits against a future order, or orders, with us (&lsquo;Offset&rsquo;/&rsquo;Offsetting&rsquo;).</span></li>
					<li><span >You must use your Silverwing Credits within 24 months of the month in which the Offer Period of the Relevant Silverwing Price Curve relating to the product purchased, ended. &nbsp;If you do not redeem your Silverwing Credits either via a Withdrawal or via Offsetting, your Silverwing Credits will expire making them non-redeemable. &nbsp;This shall be the case regardless of when those Silverwing Credits became &lsquo;Available&rsquo; to use. Silverwing Credits will expire after this time has lapsed and will no longer appear on your Account.</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing Credits can be Offset across multiple purchases with us or against a single purchase with us, as a partial or full offset of the value of the Current Price payable for any purchase.</span></li>
					<li><span >Payment must be made in full for the Price Paid, before credits will become Available. &nbsp;You may choose to Withdraw your Available Silverwing Credits. The Withdrawal may take up to 10 working days. For the avoidance of doubt, Silverwing will not fulfil requests to send such payments to any bank details that are not appropriately registered on your Account.</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing reserves the right to forfeit a Silverwing Account Holder&rsquo;s Silverwing Credits in full or in part, without notice or liability to you, in the following circumstances:</span>

						<ol>
							<li><span >Where Silverwing is aware or has reason to believe a Silverwing Account Holder has breached the Terms of this Agreement. This shall include, but is not limited to, where Silverwing Credits are due to be shown on an Account which has been:</span>

								<ol>
									<li><span >suspended, disabled or terminated by us under section 2: &lsquo;Terms of Use&rsquo; of this Agreement;</span></li>
									<li><span >is suspected or known to be associated with fraudulent activity; and&nbsp;</span></li>
									<li><span >used to make purchases on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any other person.</span></li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><span >The Qualifying Purchase and/or order in question is cancelled after it has been entered into, for example where a purchased product is returned or a right to cancel the transaction is exercised. This renders the purchase &lsquo;Disqualified&rsquo;.</span></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span ><strong>MINIMUM REDEMPTION CRITERIA</strong></span>

				<ol>
					<li><span >The minimum amount of Available Silverwing Credits you are permitted to Withdraw at any given time is &pound;1.00, and you are entitled to make a maximum of two Withdrawal requests per day. &nbsp;If your Silverwing Credit balance falls below &pound;1.00 you are unable to request a Withdrawal.</span></li>
					<li><span >There is no minimum value of Silverwing Credits that you are able to use for the purposes of Silverwing Offsetting.</span></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><span ><strong>SUPPLIER CREDIT FACILITY APPLICATIONS</strong></span>

				<ol>
					<li><span >You must apply for a Supplier Credit Facility with a Supplier via the Silverwing Service, this agreement is entered into between you and a Supplier, and Silverwing is not a party to this Supplier Credit Facility agreement.</span></li>
					<li><span >Please note that any Supplier Credit Facility which you apply for via the Silverwing Service is not considered a regulated activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</span></li>
					<li><span >During this transaction, Silverwing acts as an intermediary between you and the Supplier, and facilitates the secure transfer and processing of information between you and the Supplier.</span></li>
					<li><span >Silverwing is not in any way responsible for the lending policy, criteria, creditworthiness assessment methodology, agreement terms, lending decisions or associated processes which Suppliers use in order to grant credit or manage credit facilities or collect related payments.</span></li>
					<li><span >If you are in dispute with the outcome of your Supplier Credit Facility Application or the terms of the Supplier Credit Facility, your dispute is with the Supplier and not Silverwing.</span></li>
					<li><span >Your available Supplier Credit Facility balance will be visible on the Silverwing Platform, and the Supplier will notify Silverwing of any changes to this balance.</span></li>
