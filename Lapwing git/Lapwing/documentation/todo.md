## Remove dev profileâ€¦

Currently in maven we have profiles for
- dev
- local
- prod

Remove the dev profile. I believe that we should use local. Should we rename prod to production?

## Run both clients from a single bash file

currently you have to create two terminal windows and run 

Window 1

$ cd ./shoal-platform/shoal-client/

$ npm run start-watch

Window 2

$ cd ./shoal-platform/shoal-admin-client/

$ npm run start-watch

Can we write a bit of bash trickery to put both into the same window.
